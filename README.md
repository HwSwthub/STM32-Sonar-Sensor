# STM32-Sonar-Sensor


## Project 

This project was done as part of the Hardware and Software course. This project allows to make links between software development and the use of hardware. 
To do this, the files made available make it possible to understand the operation of the I2C and interrupts by using a STM32F303RE Nucleo 64 chip and an SRF02 distance sensor.


## STM32 
The STM32 is a new and popular processor and tool. 
Similarly, you will need to prepare a tutorial based on one of the devices provided. 
The difficulty will be to understand how to use and configure the tool for this target processor. 
The tutorial should guide the user through the steps of creating a work application based 
on the development tool, design flow, library, selected device and processor used: 
it will then consist of preparing and configuring the tool, creating or selecting 
(if the driver is already available in the library) a driver based on the selected device, 
configuring the device and transferring data, creating the application that will display the final result.
 The tool will be available as well as the processor to use. Some examples of device use are also available.




## Items 
Among the different files on this github are: 
- STM32.zip (all codes related to sensor driving by the using of I2C and interrupts)
- TutorialSTM32.pdf (Full tutorial of the different steps of this project explaining the use of I2C and interrupts)
- Presentation.pptx (Powerpoint of the presention of the project which can give an overview about the realisation of the project)
- Video.mp4 (Visual presentation of the different pins configuration)
- DatasheetSRF02.pdf (Datasheet of the SRF02 sensor)


## How to start with STM32 ? 

1) Unzip the files ; 
2) Read carefully the TutorialSTM32.pdf ; 
3) Watch the video.mp4
4) Launch the differents software and enjoy !
