# STM32-Sonar-Sensor


## Project 

<div align="justify"> This project was done as part of the Hardware and Software course at the Faculty of Engineering of Mons. This project allows to make links between software development and the use of hardware. 
To do this, the available files make it possible to understand the operation of the I2C and interrupts by using a STM32F303RE Nucleo 64 chip and an SRF02 distance sensor.</div>

Here's a first look to the chip :

## STM32 

STM32 is a chip that is increasingly used in the world of electronics. 
We have created a tutorial to help you understand the basic concepts of the STM32 F303RE chip.
The tutorial presents all the steps to create and develop a project both in terms of software and hardware.

The tutorial is progressive. At the beginning, the user will learn through the different unit tests which are : 
* Driving a LED 
* Uses of a button
* Implementation of the I2C communication protocol
* Implementation of the interrupts
Then, the user will be able to realize a complete project by using the various notions acquired in the unit tests to drive a ultrasound sensor.




## Items 

As you can see on the Github, there are different files which are: 

* STM32.zip (all codes related to sensor driving by the using of I2C and interrupts)
* TutorialSTM32.pdf (Full tutorial of the different steps of this project explaining the use of I2C and interrupts)
* Presentation.pptx (Powerpoint of the presention of the project which can give an overview about the realisation of the project)
* Video.mp4 (Visual presentation of the different pins configuration)
* DatasheetSRF02.pdf (Datasheet of the SRF02 sensor)


## How to start with STM32 ? 

1) Unzip the files ; 
2) Read carefully the TutorialSTM32.pdf ; 
3) Watch the video.mp4
4) Launch the differents software and follow the tutoriel for more informations
5) Enjoy !
